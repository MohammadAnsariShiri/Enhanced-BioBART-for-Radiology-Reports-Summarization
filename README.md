## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains our implementation of an **enhanced BioBART** model for abstractive summarization of radiology reports, fine-tuned on the radiology subset of the MIMIC-III dataset. We introduce structural tokens to denote report sections (e.g., Findings vs. Impression) and length-control tokens (`<SUM_SHORT>`, `<SUM_MEDIUM>`, `<SUM_LONG>`), and employ advanced training strategies—**Progressive Unfreezing** and **Curriculum Learning**—to optimize performance.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Domain-Adapted Model**  
  Based on the pre-trained BioBART model (`GanjinZero/biobart-v2-base`) for biomedical text.
- **Structural Tokens & Length Control**  
  Special tokens inserted to mark sections and guide summary length.
- **Advanced Training Strategies**  
  - *Progressive Unfreezing*: Gradual unfreezing of model layers across epochs  
  - *Curriculum Learning*: Gradual increase of training sample size every 3 epochs
- **Evaluation Framework**  
  - Standard metrics: ROUGE-1/2/L, BLEU  
  - Clinical metric: Clinical Entity Overlap (precision, recall, F1) using scispaCy

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/Enhanced-BioBART-for-Radiology-Report-Summarization.git
      cd Enhanced-BioBART-for-Radiology-Report-Summarization
   
2. Install dependencies
    
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. Obtain MIMIC-III data
   
   Due to licensing restrictions, MIMIC-III cannot be shared in this repo.Apply for credentialed access via PhysioNet: https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/Once approved, download and place the radiology notes.

6. Run the notebook
   
   Open and execute Enhanced_BioBART_Radiology_Summarization.ipynb in Jupyter or Colab.Adjust the DATA_PATH and MODEL_CACHE_DIR variables at the top as needed.
